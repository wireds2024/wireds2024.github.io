# About

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Software powers our everyday lives. The First International Workshop on Intertwining Research & Education on Software (WIREDS2024) is a pioneering initiative designed to bridge the gap between research and education within the Japanese software community to bring top class research to the global community. This workshop aims to foster an environment where expert researchers, students, educators, and practitioners can engage in meaningful dialogue about cutting-edge and disruptive innovations in software development and engineering.
<br>
<br>
WIREDS2024 seeks to establish a local platform for the next generation of younger researchers in Japan by brining in rising stars from the global. The workshop is committed to cultivating a collaborative atmosphere that encourages the sharing of diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to the growth and evolution of software research—not only in Japan but in a way that is mutually beneficial for the global community.
<br>
<br>
The theme for WIREDS 2024 is the "Disruptive Innovation of Generative AI". We will be inviting experts from the Global SE community to share some ideas and provide feedback to our Japanese community. 
</p>


# Why Attend?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Our goal is to facilitate a space for contributions, advice and discussions that align with these three activities:
</p>

- **Research:** Gain early feedback on your research from experts. Practise presentation skills, and seek potential collaborators.

- **Education:** Learn about the latest trends in Software such as the impact of generative Artifical Intelligence and augmentated computing and visualization. 
  
- **Promotion of Young Researchers:** Contribute to nuturing the next generation of world-class Young Researchers in the Early Stages of their Careers. We also aim to connect local Japanese researchers with rising scientist from the global community.  

# Call for Contributions
The workshops are partially hybrid, so presenter can make a presentation online. However, online presenters cannot see the offline presentations.
All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wireds2024){:target="_blank"}.


- **Fast Abstracts as Posters**: These are 2 page abstracts that will be presented as Posters and will be given a few minutes elevator talk.
We have two options for this track. All submissions in PDF format must adhere to the IEEE conference proceedings template. **Accepted papers will be available only for participants**.
  -  **Lightly-Reviewed Fast Abstracts:** Submission with this option will be lightly-reviewed. The purpose of the review is to promote discussion that will be useful for advancing research and to encourage the authors to submit their work to the top international conferences or journals. The title of the paper and author list will be published on the website.
  -  **Non-Reviewed Fast Abstracts:** Submission with this option will not be reviewed. This option is also open to those who are submitting their research to peer-reviewed conferences or journals, or who have already had their research accepted for publication. The title of the paper and author list will not be published on the website.

**Topic of Interest**
Topic of interest includes Research and Education on Software.

# Venue
WIREDS2024 will be held in the center of Osaka at [Osaka University Nakanoshima Center](https://www.onc.osaka-u.ac.jp/){:target="_blank"}. Located in the heart of Japan, Osaka offers a unique experience that differs from what you might expect in other parts of the country. Osaka enjoys mild temperatures in December, with an average high temperature of 12°C (54°F) in the afternoon and a daily low temperature of 5°C (41°F) in the middle of the night.<br>
Although Osaka is Japan's second-largest city, it maintains a welcoming charm that draws more than 10 million tourists per year due to its blend of modern attractions and rich cultural heritage. The city is close to famous sites like Kyoto and Nara and is known for its vibrant nightlife, delicious street food, and bustling shopping districts. Rich with excitement and alive with cultural diversity, beauty, and history, visitors are attracted to Osaka’s warm hospitality, year-round festivals, and historic charm.
